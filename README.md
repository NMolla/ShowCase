# ShowCase

This is a repository with all the cool C++ assignments and projects I did
  while taking Object Oriented Programming with Professor John Sterling at NYU Tandon SOE as a sophmore.
  
All the codes compile and run without crashing.

Just a demonstration of my coding habits and good programming practices.
